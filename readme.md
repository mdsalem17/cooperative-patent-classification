We used google colab for this project. To run the contents of the inforet7-v1.ipynb file, you just need to put this folder on your drive and change the following two cells:
- Remember to fill in your authorization code after executing the first cell (mont)
- You will need to point the base directory to the drive directory containing these files ; basedir = Path ('/ content / drive / MyDrive / your_file_path')
